# AvrilLavigne

Avril Ramona Lavigne is a Canadian pop-superstar, who was born in Belleville, Ontario in 1984. She first broke out on the scene with hit singles like "Girlfriend", "Complicated" and "Sk8er boi" in the early 2000's. Twitter lore has it that the OG Canadian queen Avril died in 2003, and was replaced by a look-alike named "Melissa." This theory is in the realm of wild internet conspiracy theories which has attained an ironic meme status.
