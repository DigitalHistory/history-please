Born in 1890 in Gravenhurst, Ontario, Bethune was renowned as a physician and surgeon. He graduated from University of Toronto, receiving his M.D in 1916. As an outspoken communist, he travelled and did work in China where his zeal impressed Mao Zedong, who later wrote his obituary. Today, Chinese school children are familiar with his name because of this obituary, which was added to elementary school curriculums in the 1960s.
