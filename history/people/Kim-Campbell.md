#Kim Campbell
Kim Campbell was Prime Minister of Canada from June 25, 1993 to November 4, 1993. Campbell remains the only *female* Prime Minister to ever serve in Canada, though unfortunately, she never actually sat in Parliament as Prime Minister.
Kim Campbell became Prime Minister when Brian Mulroney retired from politics in the same year, and was never formally elected to the position. On October 25 1993, Kim Campbell and the Conservative Party lost the election.
