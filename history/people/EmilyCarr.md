> In the 1930s [Emily Carr] began devoting most of her attention to landscape, particularly the forest, as subject matter. The use of a new medium, oil on paper, allowed her greater freedom to work outdoors. These paintings are among her most important contributions to Canadian art. They express her profound identification with the landscape of the province and her belief that nature was a tangible expression of God. 

> By the late 1930s, having suffered a series of heart attacks, Carr found it harder to travel. She began to focus more of her energy on writing and produced an unusual and important series of books, including Klee Wyck, a book of stories based on her experiences in First Nations villages, which won the Governor General's Award for Literature in 1941. She died in 1945, in her native Victoria, at the age of 74, recognized as an artist and writer of major importance.
