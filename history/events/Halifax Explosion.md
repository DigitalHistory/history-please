### The Halifax Explosion of 1917 was massive explosion in Halifax, Nova Scotia caused by the collison of the *SS Imo* and *SS Mont-Blanc* on December 6, 1917. The *SS Mont-Blanc* was a cargo vessel filled with explosives, and thus the resulting collision created a massive explosion. Over 2000 were killed, and the event was considered the greatest man-made explosion of its time until the dropping of the atomic bombs Little Boy and Fat Man at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

Did you know that because of the explosion all the windows in Halifax were shattered causing 40+ people to go blind and almost 700 people ended up with eye injury.  https://discoverhalifaxns.com/halifax-explosion-facts/
