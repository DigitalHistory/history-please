## Harlem Renaissance
The Harlem Renaissance was a period in the 20th century marked by social, literary, and artistic development in black Manhattan.
Occuring simultaneously with the Roaring 20s, it was dubbed "the New Negro Movement" in its time.
Prominent figures of this period included Langston Hughes, Zara Neale Hurston, Countee Cullen and Augusta Savage.
It signified a new black identity centered around the Black American experience and revolutioned the way Blacks were viewed in larger society. As a result of mass migration from the southern parts of the country to the north, stereotypes of black people as rural and uneducated were replaced by images of cool, cosmopolitan academics and artists.
Though mainly speerheaded by Harlem locals, many francophone African & European blacks contributed and were influenced by the movement.
Fashion, literature - both critical and discourse, religion, music and art came out of this very explosive time.
