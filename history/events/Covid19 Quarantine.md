## The Canadian Coronavirus Quarantine (2020)

 While the Corona Virus had its roots in the Wuhan province in China in 2019, the disease was only confirmed to have reached Canada in January of 2020. As of mid March many provinces in the country declared a state of emergency leading to a quarantine of the country. Travellers are instructed to self isoolate for 14 days and many businesses deemed non-essential are to be closed temporarily.
 While some provincial governments have plans of reopening gradually there are no plans as of yet.

Few months later, now we are in stage 3 of reopening in Ontario. However, with the number of cases rising again, is the government going to take steps back and move the province to stage 2 or even stage 1?
