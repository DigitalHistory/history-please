The Oregon Treaty of 1846 was a bilateral treaty ending the Oregon boundary dispute between The United States and Britain. The treaty set the border between British North America and the U.S. as the 49th parallel with the notable exception of the colony of Vancouver Island. It failed to include [Point Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Roberts,_Washington), as it was south of the 49th parallel, turning the town into a pene-exclave.
