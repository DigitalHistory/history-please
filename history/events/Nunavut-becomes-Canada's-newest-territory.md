## Nunavut becomes Canada's newest territory
On April 1st, 1999, Nunavut joins Canada as a territory. Nunavut was created through a federal act which saw it separate 
from the Northwest Territories and became Canada's newest territory. The creation of Nunavut was due to a large land claim
between the Canadian government & the native Inuit people. Nunavut means "our land" in Inuktitut, the Inuit language.
