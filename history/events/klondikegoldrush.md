# Klondike Gold Rush
In 1897 gold was discovered by George Washington Carmack, Skookum Jim, and Tagish Charlie on Bonanza Creek, a tributary on the Klondike River of Yukon in north-western Canada. From 1897 to 1899, 100,000 prospectors mirgrated to the region with only a minority of migrants achieving notable wealth in the rush. When gold was discovered in western Alaska in 1899, mining in the area went into sharp decline, provoking the vast majority of miners to leave for Alaska.
