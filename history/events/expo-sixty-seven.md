# Expo 67
The 1967 Universal Exposition (Expo 67) was held in Montreal between April 27 and October 29. 61 countries participated, showcasing their unique cultures and technologies on individual pavillions across the exposition grounds. 

Expo 67 was initially meant to be hosted in Moscow, however, the Soviets cancelled and Canada received the right to host the exposition. This timing was significant as it coincided with Canada's centennial anniversary.

Much of Expo 67 was hosted on artificially constructed islands, and the expo also spurred the development of Montreal's transit system and other public works. In this sense, Expo 67 changed the face of Montreal and played a role in modernizing the city.

It was considered one of the most successful World Fairs of the 20th Century and preformed better finacially than expected to.  The former American Pavilion still remains and is now known as the Montreal Biosphere, a museum dedicated to the enviornment on Saint Helen's Island.
