Tim Hortons is a Canadian coffee house chain founded in 1964 by a Canadian hockey player of the same name. There are more than 4,600 locations worldwide, with most being concentrated within Canada itself. It is a go-to stereotype and source of Canadian pride and identity. After 2002, Tim Hortons surpassed McDonald's as the largest food service operator in Canada. As of March 2006, Tim Hortons held over 75% of the Canadian domestic baked goods market.
